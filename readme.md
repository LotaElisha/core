# Layla - A sexy CMS that knows what it wants

Let's make managing a website easy and fun again, even for you!


## Why?
=======
# [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - A PHP Framework For Web Artisans

Laravel is a clean and classy framework for PHP web development. Freeing you
from spaghetti code, Laravel helps you create wonderful applications using
simple, expressive syntax. Development should be a creative experience that you
enjoy, not something that is painful. Enjoy the fresh air.
