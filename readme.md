# Layla - A sexy CMS that knows what it wants

Let's make managing a website easy and fun again, even for you!


## Why?

A wide varity of CMS solutions are offered and available today. Why the need for another one?

Layla is a project that started when we (Rojtjo and Vespakoen) decided to team up after finding out we were both building a CMS for Laravel

We have different reasons for building our own CMS, but here are the most important ones.


## What?

We don't have a lot to show off yet so let's get geeky and present to you a rough outline of Layla.

Layla consists of the following components

*	Domain

	*	Authorisation
	*	Validation
	*	Database interaction
	*	REST API(JSON over HTTP)


*	Admin

	*	Pages
	*	Layouts
		*	Template
		*	Partial
		*	Stylesheet
		*	Javascript
	*	Media
		*	Images
		*	Movies
			*	Youtube
			*	Vimeo
	*	Accounts
		*	Permissions
	*	Modules
		*	WYSIWYG (Redactor.JS)
		*	Menu
		*	Module builder

*	Components
	
	*	Third-party bundles
	*	Our own bundles to give back to the community


*	Client
	
	*	The frontend (building up, caching and presenting the content)
	
More details will follow soon...


## How?

In the evenings we find peace of mind while working on Layla and are making steady progress already.

Although we know the stage of the project is still very young and fragile, we do welcome pull-requests and team members.

We also setup a [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/layla-development/4fb2c7f48bea67b80900baa0 "Take a look!") that includes the roadmap, ideas etc.
